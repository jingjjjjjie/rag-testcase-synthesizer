I will provide you with a question, referred to as the "original question", an answer to the original question, and a rephrased "new question" derived from the original question. Your task is to help me generate detailed scoring criteria for this "new question".

Example:

Original Question: How much has Apple's revenue increased compared to last year?
Answer: Apple's revenue increased by 6% year-over-year, reaching $94.9 billion.

------
Please note:
(1) The scoring criteria should be formulated by comparing the original question with the transformed question, considering the answer, and reflecting on the transformation that led to the "new question".
(2) Your scoring criteria should be detailed and comprehensive, meaning they should be clear enough to allow scoring based solely on the criteria, question, and answer, without needing additional knowledge.
(3) The scoring criteria should begin with "If the response shows that the respondent recognizes/knows/understands ..." to indicate the expected behavior for awarding points.
(4) If the transformed type is Equivalent Transformation, the scoring criteria should focus on the respondent's understanding that the question before and after transformation expresses the same meaning. If the transformed type is Partial Transformation, the scoring criteria should focus on the respondent's understanding that the new sub-question about the change cannot be answered.

Your output should strictly follow the format below.

[[TRANSFORMED QUESTION]]

Begin! Please note that the maximum score for your evaluation criteria is only 1 point. It is crucial that you strictly generate the scoring criteria based on the differences between the transformed question and the original question, indicating that the generated answer should reflect its awareness of this "difference" and thus cannot be answered.
