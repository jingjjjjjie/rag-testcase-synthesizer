Please note:
(1) The scoring criteria should be formulated by comparing the original question with the transformed question, considering the answer, and reflecting on the transformation that led to the "new question".
(2) The scoring criteria should be detailed and comprehensive, meaning they should be clear enough to allow scoring based solely on the criteria, question, and answer, without needing additional knowledge.
(3) The scoring criteria should begin with "If the response shows that the respondent recognizes/knows/understands ..." to indicate the expected behavior for awarding points.

Your output should strictly follow the format below.
