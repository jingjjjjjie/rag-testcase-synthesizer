"CHAT BOT (QUESTION AND ANSWER) – PHASE 4  \n1) Can workers opt out of the savings program? The savings program is a structured initiative designed to provide financial support during emergencies, ensuring workers maintain financial stability and security. Participation is strongly encouraged, as consistent savings contribute to long-term financial well-being.  \n\n2) Are workers allowed to smoke in hostels? Smoking policies in hostels are typically strict, with many accommodations prohibiting smoking indoors to ensure a safe and healthy environment. Workers are advised to follow hostel regulations and use designated smoking areas if available.  \n\n3) Will I return to the same job after my holiday? Your reassignment depends on customer arrangements, as some may hire replacement workers during your absence. If the customer has arranged for a replacement, your previous position may no longer be available. In such cases, management will provide an alternative job placement based on availability and operational needs. Workers will be informed of their reassignment details in a timely manner. Factors such as the length of absence, customer demand, and operational requirements may influence reassignment decisions. Employees are encouraged to consult with management beforehand to understand their options.  \n\n4) What should I do if my savings are deducted monthly but not reflected in my statement? Inform your immediate superior or designated interpreter as soon as possible to lodge a formal complaint. They will escalate the issue to the Payroll department to resolve the matter and ensure your statement is properly updated. Management will escalate the issue to the Payroll department for investigation and resolution. The Payroll department will review the records, correct any discrepancies, and ensure your statement is properly updated. Workers should monitor subsequent statements and confirm that the corrections have been made. If the issue persists, they should seek further clarification from the Payroll department.  \n\n5) How do I handle an expired passport? Management continuously tracks passport expiration dates to ensure timely renewal. Workers should be aware that a passport must remain valid for at least 18 months before the work permit expires to comply with regulatory requirements. Workers will receive advance notice of their passport renewal date, along with appointment details at the respective embassy. They are advised to prepare any necessary documents beforehand to prevent delays. An interpreter will accompany the worker to the designated embassy, providing support with communication and ensuring a smooth renewal process. Passport renewal fees vary by nationality: Nepal – RM240; Bangladesh – RM305; Myanmar – RM430. Failure to renew the passport on time may result in work permit complications, fines, or penalties that could affect the worker’s employment status. Workers must adhere to renewal deadlines to prevent disruptions.  \n\n6) What should I do if my new permit has not been issued by Immigration, despite my old permit expiring? Delays in work permit issuance may occur due to various factors, such as pending FOMEMA medical results, a lost passport, or other administrative processing issues. Workers should check with management to identify the specific reason for the delay. If the new permit is delayed, a Special Pass (SP) can be issued as a temporary permit, valid for one month while awaiting the new permit. A RM100 fee is required for the Special Pass application, which should be paid as per immigration procedures. Workers should verify whether this fee is covered by the company or if they are responsible for payment. If the new permit continues to be delayed, the Special Pass will be renewed continuously until Immigration issues the new work permit. Workers should ensure they follow up regularly for status updates. The company’s administration will oversee the entire process, including permit applications and renewals. Workers are encouraged to stay informed and coordinate with management regarding their permit status.  \n\n7) What should I do if my passport is lost? Report the loss to your immediate superior or designated interpreter as soon as possible. It is advisable to do this promptly to avoid delays in the replacement process. Management will arrange for a police report, and the worker must accompany them to file it. Ensure all relevant details are provided accurately. After obtaining the police report, submit it along with any required supporting documents to the respective embassy to apply for a replacement passport. Workers should be aware of any applicable fees for the passport replacement process. Once the new passport is issued, proceed to the Immigration Department to apply for a valid work permit. Workers should also ensure that they securely store copies of their passport and permit.  \n\n8) Documents retained by workers while their passports are held by management. Workers will be provided with a laminated photocopy of their passport or permit and are encouraged to keep it secure, as they may need to present it for verification when inspected by authorities. If the laminated copy is lost or damaged, workers should promptly report it to the designated contact person for replacement. Workers are advised to carry the laminated copy whenever they go out to ensure smooth interactions with authorities and avoid unnecessary complications. If inspected by authorities, workers should present the laminated copy for verification, as digital copies may not always be accepted. Additionally, workers can access digital copies of their passport or permit through the MTS On The Go apps.  \n\n9) How to view my salary statement? You can view your salary statement by logging into the MTS On The Go apps. Once logged in, navigate to the \"Salary\" section and select the option to view your statement. Salary statements for previous months may also be available. If you encounter any issues, such as missing salary details or difficulties accessing the platform, promptly contact your immediate superior or the designated interpreter for assistance.  \n\n10) What is refund process after returning from holiday? Upon returning from holiday, the deposit and other related amounts, including one-way airfare, will be processed for release within one week. However, funds are disbursed every Wednesday, meaning the actual release date depends on the closest Wednesday following the worker’s return. Workers should ensure they complete any necessary administrative steps to facilitate the refund process. If there are delays, workers should promptly consult the designated department for clarification and resolution."
