Additionally, an interpreter may be present during the embassy visit to support communication for the applicant [Clue 2]. These two relationships provide information about both procedural requirements and available assistance during the embassy process.",

        "corrected-answer": {
          "short-answer": {
            "reason": "The reference [Doc doc1_question5, Sen 21] is incorrect because it refers to interpreter support during a *renewal* process, not a *replacement* scenario. The correct sentence for interpreter support during an embassy visit in the context of replacement should still be evaluated within the appropriate context. However, [Doc doc1_question7, Sen 38] correctly identifies that the police report must be submitted to the embassy for the replacement application. There is no explicit mention of interpreter support during the *replacement* embassy visit in doc1_question7; only that an interpreter supports during renewal (doc1_question5, Sen 21). Since the question asks about replacement, and interpreter support is only explicitly stated for renewal—not replacement—the reference to Sen 21 is misleading. Therefore, only [Sen 38] provides direct evidence of required documentation, and there is insufficient direct support for interpreter assistance during replacement.",

          "long-answer": {
            "reason": "In addition to [Doc doc1_question7, Sen 38], which directly states that the police report and supporting documents must be submitted to the embassy, other relevant sentences include [Doc doc1_question7, Sen 36] (management arranges police report and worker must accompany), [Sen 37] (ensure accurate details), and [Sen 40] (next steps after new passport issuance). While interpreter support is explicitly mentioned in [Doc doc1_question5, Sen 21], it pertains to the *renewal* process, not the *replacement* process. Since the procedures are similar and interpreters are generally designated for embassy visits, referencing Sen 21 may still be contextually justified in a broader interpretation. Thus, including both [Doc doc1_question7, Sen 36,37,38] and [Doc doc1_question5, Sen 21] captures all aligned information related to documentation submission and available support.",

Clue 2 indicates that a worker's eligibility to work depends on holding a valid work permit, which in turn is contingent on passport validity. By combining these two relationships, it can be deduced that without a valid passport, a worker cannot obtain or renew a work permit, thereby losing eligibility to work.",

The relationship between Immediate Superior and Payroll Department shows that the Immediate Superior forwards the complaint to the Payroll Department for resolution. Combining these two relationships, the Immediate Superior acts as an intermediary who receives the initial report about Salary Statement issues and escalates it to the Payroll Department.",

        "reasoning": "Based on Clue 1, Workers are advised to consult Management to determine the specific reason for their work permit delay. From Clue 2, Workers are required to carry a Laminated Copy when going out and present it if inspected. Combining these two relationships, the question addresses both procedural actions related to work permit delays and documentation requirements during movement. The answer can be directly derived from the stated obligations in both clues.",

            "reason": "The reference [Doc doc1_question6, Sen 26] correctly points to the sentence stating that workers should check with management to identify the specific reason for the delay, which directly answers the first part of the question. The references [Doc doc1_question8, Sen 43, 44] correctly point to the sentences stating that workers should carry the laminated copy when going out and present it if inspected, which directly answer the second part of the question. These are the most concise sentences that fully address both parts of the question.",
            "answer": "Workers must consult Management to determine the reason for their work permit delay [Doc doc1_question6, Sen 26] and carry the Laminated Copy when going out, presenting it if inspected [Doc doc1_question8, Sen 43, 44]."

Although digital copies are accessible via the MTS On The Go apps, the requirement to carry the laminated copy is emphasized because digital versions may not be accepted during inspections. Including these additional references strengthens alignment with the full scope of actions and documentation related to permit delays and carrying requirements.",
