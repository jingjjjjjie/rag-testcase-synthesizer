Delays in work permit issuance may occur due to various factors, such as pending FOMEMA medical results, a lost passport, or other administrative processing issues. Workers should check with management to identify the specific reason for the delay. If the new permit is delayed, a Special Pass (SP) can be issued as a temporary permit, valid for one month while awaiting the new permit.

            "result": "From the perspective of a human resources officer, what are the defined roles of technical support, direct supervisors, and HR oversight in assisting employees who continue to experience difficulties retrieving compensation information after failed login verification, how do these roles differ for remote employees or those requiring language interpretation, and what formal escalation procedures exist if the issue remains unresolved over seven business days?",
            "answer": "Assuming the issue persists after verification of login credentials, from the perspective of a human resources officer, employees should be directed to contact their direct supervisor or the designated interpreter for help if they experience difficulties retrieving compensation information or have missing information [Doc doc1_question9, Sen 49]. This confirms the role of direct supervisors and interpreters in the resolution process. However, there is no information about the involvement of technical support teams, the function of HR oversight units, differences in protocol for remote employees, or formal escalation procedures beyond the initial reporting step within a seven-day window."
