            "reason": "The reference [Doc doc1_question5, Sen 21] is incorrect because it refers to interpreter support during a *renewal* process, not a *replacement* scenario. The correct sentence for interpreter support during an embassy visit in the context of replacement should still be evaluated within the appropriate context. However, [Doc doc1_question7, Sen 38] correctly identifies that the police report must be submitted to the embassy for the replacement application. There is no explicit mention of interpreter support during the *replacement* embassy visit in doc1_question7; only that an interpreter supports during renewal (doc1_question5, Sen 21). Since the question asks about replacement, and interpreter support is only explicitly stated for renewal—not replacement—the reference to Sen 21 is misleading. Therefore, only [Sen 38] provides direct evidence of required documentation, and there is insufficient direct support for interpreter assistance during replacement.",

While interpreter support is explicitly mentioned in [Doc doc1_question5, Sen 21], it pertains to the *renewal* process, not the *replacement* process. Since the procedures are similar and interpreters are generally designated for embassy visits, referencing Sen 21 may still be contextually justified in a broader interpretation.
